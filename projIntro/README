 Project 0
===========

Please start with the file 'Python_Tutorial.tex'
- It is a LaTeX file; LaTeX is a document markup language. 
- If you've never used LaTeX before, then there are instructions right at the top of this file for how to compile this .tex file into a PDF.

Then, move onto the 'Project0_Template.tex' and work through those questions.

To submit the project, you can compile 'Project0_Template.tex' into a PDF and upload it to Gradescope.

 
Let us know if you run into any problems!
